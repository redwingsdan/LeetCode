Given a singly linked list, return a random node's value from the linked list. Each node must have the same probability of being chosen.

Implement the Solution class:

Solution(ListNode head) Initializes the object with the integer array nums.
int getRandom() Chooses a node randomly from the list and returns its value. All the nodes of the list should be equally likely to be choosen.
